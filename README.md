# Welcome Github Scribes!

What is a Github Scribe? A Github Scribe is a single member of a project team who will be responsible for creating your projects Github repository during the Sprint. The Scribe will also be responsible for keeping the project repository up-to-date for the duration of the Sprint. We will jump into the selection of Scribes before Lunch on Day 1 of the Sprint so for now there is no action you need to take.

## Scribes: Please complete the following steps for your Team project to create a beautiful, organized home for all your work:

- [Step 1: Create your project Repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome#step-1-create-your-project-repository)
- [Step 2: Update your projects README file using our template](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome#step-2-update-your-projects-readme-file-using-our-template)
- [Step 3: Review Best Practices](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome#step-3-review-best-practices)
- [Optional: Create a Directory folder in your project Repository in support of Wiki images](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome#optional-create-a-directory-folder-in-your-project-repository-in-support-of-wiki-images)


### Step 1: Create your project Repository:
> A project repository is your Sprint projects' home. It's a place where all of your project files (documentation, user-stories, code, etc.) will live so that others in the open source community (including Salesforce.org) can have open access to all your work in order to track progress. A repository has the added benefit of allowing future contributors to continue the work started at this Sprint.

1. Navigate to __https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints__
2. Click the New button (Green button)
3. From the Create a new repository page fill in the requested information

> __Here is an Example:__<br><br>

4. Click the Create Repository button<br>


### Step 2: Update your projects README file using our template:
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about. It acts like the Home page for all projects.

1. Navigate to the __[Project README template](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome/wiki/Project-README.md-file-template)__
2. Click the Edit button and copy the template
3. Navigate to your projects README.md file
4. Click the pencil icon to edit the README.md file and paste the template in
5. Commit Changes when done

### Step 3: Review Best Practices:

:point_right: __We HIGHLY recommend that you and your project team Watch your Project's repo!__ <br>
Watching your projects repository allows you to receive notifications for new pull requests and issues that are created. Please ensure all members of the project team complete this step. Click __[here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository)__ to learn more!

:point_right: __Your Project's README file needs to be kept up to date both during and after the Sprint so that we know what you worked on and who was on the team.__<br> 
Doing so ensures that anyone reviewing your project repositiory (during or after the Sprint) understands the current state of your project which supports trust, transparency, and collaboration from the open source community. Review our __[Sample README file](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome/wiki/Sample-Sprint-Project-README.md-file)__ as a reference.

:point_right: __Use your project repository Wiki to store your project documentation__<br>
Every GitHub repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. Take a look at Github's __[About wikis page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-wikis)__ for more information.

:point_right: __Use the Welcome [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome/wiki) for helpful tips & tricks!__<br>
The Wiki provides links to a list of resources to help you navigate through your Sprint experience in Github.

:point_right: __Markdown is your friend for text style formatting__<br>
When editing your README.md file (or any file that ends with .md or .markdown) you will be using Markdown language. Be sure to access the __[Mastering Markdown Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)__ to help you understand the different formatting options that are available.

:boom: __Accidentily deleted your repo? No problem!__<br>

### Optional: Create a Directory folder in your project Repository in support of Wiki images
> You will use this directory to stores images (if any) for use with your repo's Wiki.

1. From your Project's repository click on Create new file
2. Type in the name of the Directory you want to create follwed by a slash (/) follwed by the name of the file that will identify what types of information will be housed here
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Wiki Documentation/Images.md
3. In the Edit new file tab add the following message: "This directory will be used to store images in support of wiki documentation efforts."
4. Add a message in the *Commit new file* section at the bottom of the file
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Wiki Images Directory <br>
> Created a Documentation directory to store images for the wiki
5. Commit Changes when done
