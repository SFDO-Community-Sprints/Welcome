### Step 1: Create your project Repository
> A project repository is your Sprint projects' home. It's a place where all of your project files (documentation, user-stories, code, etc.) will live so that others in the open source community (including Salesforce.org) can have open access to all your work in order to track progress. A repository has the added benefit of allowing future contributors to continue the work started at this Sprint.

1. Navigate to __https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia__ (right click this URL and open a new page)
2. Click the New button (Green button)
3. From the Create a new repository page fill in the requested information

> __Here is an Example:__<br><br>
> __Repository name:__ Admin Soft Skills<br>
> __Description:__ Develop standardized Salesforce System Administrator and Business Analyst job descriptions<br>
> __Public Repo__ = true<br>
> __Initialize this repository with a README__ = true<br>
> __Add .gitignore: None__ (leave this as is)<br>
> __Add a license__ = BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <br>

4. Click the Create Repository button<br>


### Step 2: Update your Repository README file using our [Project README template](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia/Welcome/wiki/Project-README.md-file-template)
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about.

After you copy and paste the template into your Project's README.md file be sure to do the following:

1. Add a message in the *Commit changes* section at the bottom of the README.md file
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Update README.md <br>
> Updated the README.md file using the Project README template
2. Ensure Commit directly to the master branch = true
3. Click Commit new file

***

### Step 3: Create a Directory folder in your project Repository in support of Wiki documentation.
> You will use this directory to stores images (if any) for use with your repo's Wiki.

1. From your Project's repository click on Create new file
2. Type in the name of the Directory you want to create follwed by a slash (/) follwed by the name of the file that will identify what types of information will be housed here
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Wiki Documentation/Images.md
3. In the Edit new file tab add the following message: "This directory will be used to store images in support of wiki documentation efforts."
4. Add a message in the *Commit new file* section at the bottom of the file
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Wiki Images Directory <br>
> Created a Documentation directory to store images for the wiki
5. Ensure Commit directly to the master branch = true
6. Click Commit new file
***

### Step 4: Review Best Practices

:point_right: __Your Project's README file must be kept up to date.__<br> 
Doing so ensures that anyone reviewing your project repositiory (during or after the Sprint) understands the current state of your project which supports trust, transparency, and collaboration from the open source community. Review our __[Sample README filehttps://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia/Welcome/wiki/Sample-Sprint-Project-README.md-file)__ as a reference.

:point_right: __Markdown is your friend for text style formatting__<br>
When editing your README.md file (or any file that ends with .md or .markdown) you will be using Markdown language. Be sure to access the __[Mastering Markdown Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)__ to help you understand the different formatting options that are available.

:point_right: __Use your project repository Wiki to store your project documentation__<br>
Every GitHub repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. Take a look at Github's __[About wikis page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-wikis)__ for more information.

:point_right: __Create a new branch for all future Commits to avoid overwriting the work of others__<br>
For the duration of the Sprint there will be changes you and your team make to files that live in your project's repository. On that note, when making edits to files in your repository, you will want to commit those changes to a new branch followed by __[Creating a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)__.

:point_right: __Use the Welcome [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia/Welcome/wiki) for helpful tips & tricks!__<br>
The Wiki provides links to a list of resources to help you navigate through your Sprint experience in Github.
